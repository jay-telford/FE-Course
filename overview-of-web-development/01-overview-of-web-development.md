### The Social Element

Learning is a social experience so connecting with the COdecademy community [forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/) will be a good idea.  Checking in with the community regularly, including for thigns like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing reviews to others in the [projects category](https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/1833) can help reinforce what I have learned.
