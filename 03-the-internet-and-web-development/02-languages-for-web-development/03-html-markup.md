# HTML Markup

The *ML* in HTML stannds for *markup language*.  Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself.  The same way that a teacher might "markup" a student essay by underlining topic sentences and circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content within a web page.  

A teacher might use a red pen to make sure that their comments are easy to distinguish from the stident's own work.  HTML seperates contenet and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less-than and greater-than sings).

# Questions

**(Q):** Is HTML considered a programming language?

**(A):** Some people might argue that HTML is a programming language, but the majority of programmers will say **NO**, it is not a programming language.

This is because, by its definition, a programming language provides functionality. It does so with a set of syntax and grammatical rules which give instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks like logical tasks, algorithms, loops, and so on.

HTML does not provide these things, which means it is not a programming language. Instead, HTML is specifically a markup language, which does not deal with logic, but with presentation.
