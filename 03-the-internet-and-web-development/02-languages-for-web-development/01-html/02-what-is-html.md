# What is HTML

The first step that Alejandra needs to take before building her website, is to learn HTML.  WHy?  *HTML* is the skeleton of all web pages.  It provides structure to the content on a website, including text, images, buttons, video and more. 

HTML is a practical place to start learning to code.  I can build basic websites after learning just a little HTML, with text, images and video.

## What does HTML stand for?

HTML stands for hypertext markup language.  In the next few exercises I will look at the HTML acronym word-by-word to ubpack what HTML really means.

# Questions

**(Q):** How can I start writing my own HTML files?

**(A):** You can write your own HTML files using a text editor, a code editor, or an integrated development environment (IDE).

One thing to keep in mind when writing and creating your own HTML files is that the file name must end with the extension .html, for example like index.html, in order to work.

**Text editor**  
Some common text editors are Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on MacOS.

**Code editor**  
Code editors are usually preferred over text editors because they provide useful features like autocomplete and syntax coloring.

Some popular code editors are Sublime, Atom, and Notepad++.

**Online Code editor**  
There are also online code editors available which let you share and edit your code, and even run your code in the browser.

These include JSFiddle, CodePen, and JS Bin.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDE’s)**  
One useful function of IDE’s is that they can be used for testing and debugging your code.

Some IDE’s include Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Adobe Dreamweaver.
