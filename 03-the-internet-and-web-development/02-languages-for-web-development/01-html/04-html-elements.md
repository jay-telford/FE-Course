# HTML Elements

HTML tags are the "markup" for HTML.  They are annotations that provide information about the type of content they contain.  Lets take a closer look at the syntax of how HTML tags surround contnt to create an HTML element. 

The table below shows how an HTML element is structured.

| **Opening Tag** | **Content** | **Closing Tag** |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| <p>             | Hello World |            </p> |

## Parts of An HTML Element

Now lets review each part of the element shown above.

* **HTML Element** - a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains
* **Opening Tag** - the elemet name used to start an HTML element.  The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets
* **Content** - the information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element
* **Closing Tag** - the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element.  Closing tags have a forward slash [/] inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.
