# What is Web Development

Millions of users have learned to make websites and applications on Codecademy - and I could be next.

Having web development skills allows me to take my big ideas - whether its a simple website, a complex web application, or even a browser game - and build them on the web.

## Meet Alejandra! 

She is a budding web developer. SHe runs a smal travel agency.  Alejandra finds her customers mostly through word of mouth, but now shes ready to expand her business by bulding a website.  This lesson will follow Alejandra along her journey to learn new languages for web development, and show what kinds of features each new skill allows Alejandra to build for her site.

During this lesson we will follow along with Alejandra as she picks up each of these languages, starting with HTML.

# Questions

**(Q):** Are tehre differnet categories in web development?

**(A)**: Yes, in Web Development there are three main categories which are Front-end, Back-end, and Full-stack Web Development.

**Front-end**  
This category mainly deals with the presentation and design of a website and includes concepts such as user interaction and experience. Some of the most commonly used languages for this category are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Back-end**  
Back-end development deals mainly with what goes on “behind the scenes” of a website or web application, such as the databases, servers, and logical components. These are usually not part of the presentation or visible to users. One common language used for back-end development is SQL, which works with databases.

**Full-stack**  
Full-stack Web Development is a combination of both Front-end and Back-end development. It deals with the entire ‘stack’ of tasks and technologies in the development process.
