# Changing How We Communicate

It is nearly impossible to overstate how much the internet has changed how we consume information and communicate with one another.  More than four billion people around the world are internet users and the total number of websites on the world wide web is nearly two billion

Despite the presence of the internet in our lives, very few internet users understand how it works.  You dont need to be an egineer to benefit from understanding how the internet works.  However, understanding the internet's infrastructure will help me to decide if learning web development is right for me. 

## In This Lesson

In this lesson, I will learn how the internet works behind the scenes.  After finish this lesson, I will be able to answer questions like:

* How is data sent from one computer to another
* What is the relationship between a browser and a server
* How is code turned into the experience that users see in their browsers
* How has the web and web development changed from its invention to today

By the end of this lesson, I will have the knowledge that I need to to collaborate more effectivly with engineers and to jump into my career in web development.
