# Community Resources

Get to know the Codecademy Community while you work on your Path

A large part of learning how to code is collaborative. Get to know the Codecademy Community while you work on your Path, whether it’s to get a project review, find a pair-programming buddy, or gain a new collaborator.

## Codecademy Community: Learning to Code with Others

Learning a programming language can be like learning a spoken language. It’s an incredible feeling when someone speaks to you and you understand what they’re saying! But it’s much more powerful when you are able to speak in response, using the new language with others.

Coding languages work similarly. To gain mastery, you must also practice using the language. You can start practicing what you’ve learned by visiting the [Codecademy Community forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/) or the [Codecademy Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/codecademy). In the community spaces, you will be able to see new posts from learners like you and test your skills by posting a response to help them. You can quickly learn about others by visiting their Codecademy Profiles, and you can introduce yourself by sharing the link to yours.

The Codecademy Community is a great place to read about others’ experiences, ask questions, and get help from your peers when you are stuck. They are also a safe place to test out your new skills by helping someone else with their question.

## Your Career Path Cohort

Finding and connecting with people who share your goals is important for accountability and motivation. To make connecting with like-minded people simple, log in to the forums and [visit your group](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/front-end-engineer-group-150-2022/706416)! Here, you will find a permanent link to accessing your group. Once you’ve introduced yourself on the group thread, the possibilities are in your hands! Continue meeting in the Forums, find one another on Discord, or create a Chapter to meet regularly over video call and support one another to Career path completion, and beyond.

## Join a Chapter, Learn Together

*(not really available in the UK)*

Codecademy Chapters are a great way to team up to reach your goals. Chapters meet virtually at a set time, and are peer-led by a Codecademy learner, just like you. Each Chapter will have a focus, ranging from web development projects, to mobile development, to technical interview preparedness. Find a Chapter near you or start your own.

Best of luck!
