# Introduction: Fundamentals of Html

In this unit, I will be introduced to the fundamentas of HTML.

The goal of this unity is to introduce me to to the fundamentals of HTML, one of the languages essential to developing websites.

After this unit, I will be able to:

* Understand how HTML is used for web development
* Use HTML to build a structure for a website
* Create tables in HTML documents 
* Write cleaner, more accessible HTML using Semantic HTML tags

Learning is social.  Whatever I am working on, I should be sure to connect with the other students on my course via the Codecademy community in the [**forums**](https://discuss.codecademy.com/) and remember to check in with the communoty regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on my project work and providing reviews to others in the [**projects category**](https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/) which can help to reinforce what I have already learned

I should also keep these notes up-to-date, making sure to record them as I am going through my course.
