## Recomended Books

Although I will be given interactive lessons throughout my Codecademy course, it can sometimes be useful to have a couple of book son hand.  These books are considered classics in the industry and many Codecademy learners have found them useful.

* [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites. Jon Duckett](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/html-css-design-and-build-websites/9781118008188)
[Cracking the Coding Interview (6th Edition), Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/1605842829_cracking-the-coding-interview/9780984782857)

Both of these books can be purchased on [bookshop.org](https://uk.bookshop.org/) and I have linkted the UK site. 

While the books listed above are recommended and will help me on my coding hourney, purchasing and reading them is optional.  Where possible, Codecademy have suggested a free alternative.  The content covers the same topics that I will find in Codecademy lessons, but may be useful for me to read more explanations and delve deeper into subject matter for additional explanations, perspectives, and other opportunities for practice.
