# What I will be learning in this Career Path

I welcome myself to the Front-End Career Path!  Because I want to make beautiful, interactive websites for both myself and as a career, I am in the right place.  This parth starts from the vewy basics sp I do not need to know anything to start as I will learn everything I need to know to apply for an entry-level job in front-end engineering:  from languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to frameworks like REact and Redux, to interview skills, like whitebarding and other data structures. 

After this Path, I will be able to:

* Build static websites with HTML and CSS
* Make my websites interactive with JavaScript
* APply basic design theory to my webpages
* Use the command line
* Manage versions of my code with Git
* Build web apps with React and Redux
* Test React applications with JEst and Enzyme
* Deploy REact applications with Netlify
* Apply SEO tactics to improve sites popularity
* Ace the engineering interview

## What I will demonstrate

I will demonstrate my knowledge in several Portfolio Projects that exist throughout the Path.  I can complete the Portfolio Projects either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content - its up to me.

for some examples see [here](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-introduction-to-front-end-engineer-career-path/modules/fecp-22-getting-started/informationals/fecp-22-welcome-to-front-end-engineer-career-path)

## Curated Content

Throughout this path I will see some items that aren't made by the Codecademy team.  They have been included to ensure that I learn all the topics I need to get my career started.  Though the Codecademy team didn't write them, they have vetted them themselves for technical accuracy and good teaching practices.  When possible, the team has written relevant assessments so that I can check my understanding back on the Codecademy platform.  

### Examples of Curated Content

Curated content may include, but is not limited to:

* Documentation
* Articles
* Videos
* Books
* Tutorials

To get the best out of my chosen course, I should engage with the curated content.
