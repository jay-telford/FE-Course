# Browsers and Servers

In my previous lessons, I learned the internet is a network that links computer devices worldwide, enabling people to share information wth one another despite vast distances - but how is that information sent from one device to another?

## The Client Server Model

One way of understanding this process is to look at the client-server model. 

### The Clent
The ***client*** refers to the user's device or program that is making the request for data.  A client can be a browser or application running on a user's laptiop, smartphone or tablet.

### The Server
The ***server*** is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data.  This might be an in-house server, a rented server at a data centre, or a cloud server.  

#### Basic Example of The Client-Server Model:
At codecademy, servers store the lesson data.  The user directs their web-browser (the client) to the codecademy website and requests leson data from the servers.  The server then respods by sending lesson data to client, which is displayed to the user.  


### A More Detailed Explanation of The Client-Server Model
A more detailed explaination of the cient-server model can be found in the video [attached to the lesson.](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-overview-of-web-development/modules/wdcp-22-the-internet-and-web-development/lessons/what-is-the-internet/exercises/browsers-and-servers)  It is a good idea to watch this video.
