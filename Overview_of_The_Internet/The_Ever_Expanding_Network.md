# In The Begining

**Question**: How did the internet start?

**Answer**: In 1969, the United States Department of Defense funded the creation of ARPANET, a precursor network to the internet.  ARPANET stands for *Advanced Research PRojects Agency Network*. ARPANET connected supercomuting centres run by govermetn agencies and universities.  

These institutions wanted to connect their individual networks for large-scale information transfer.  However, many of them followed different standards and technical implementations.  In the 1970s, the transmission control protocol and the internet protocol ***TCP/IP*** were created to provide standards around the transfer of data that woujld allow these early networks to communicate with each other. 

TCP/IP was researched and specified throughout the 1970s and adopted in the early 1980s.  As different networks adopted TCP/IP, the internconnected global network of networks that is today known as the internet was formed.
