# The World Wide Web

While people today often use the terms *internet* and *world wide web* interchangealy, they actually refer to quite different things.

The Internet refers to the actual network of connected computing devices.  Although the internet was around in the 1980s, there was not an intuitive way for most people to browse the internet.  The internet just sent messages produced by one computer and presented them to another computer.

Engagement with the internet changed in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web.  The world wide web is a collection of interlinked websites and other web resource.  The world wide web, in combination with the rise of web browsers in the 1990s, introduced a user-friendly interface that enabled users to browse the multimedia content and interact with other users. 

The invention of the world wide web led to the use of the internet in wider society through the 1990s and the creation of a ariety of websites that are still in use today.
