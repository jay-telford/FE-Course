# Jays Front End Engineer Course
In an attempt to better my life and begin a career doing something that I love, I have started a *Front End Engineer* course on Codecademy.  I am using this repository to store all of my notes, along with the code for the various sample projects that I udnerstake.

Using GitHube to store my notes, will help do the following:

1. Get me acquainted with using GitHub and its use
2. Allow me to practice using Git from the terminal
3. Allow me to pratice writing in Markdown *(md) format
4. Give me access to my notes and sample projects from anywhere with internet access

One of the best things about using Markdown, is the ability to include sample code directly in the doctument itself.
